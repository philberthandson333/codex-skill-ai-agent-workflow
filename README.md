# ai-agent-workflow

> Repeatable AI workflows with prompts, tools, MCP integrations, and evaluation loops.

中文简介：这是一个面向 AI 工作流设计的 Codex skill，适合把一次性提示词任务沉淀成可复用的 prompts、tools、MCP 集成和评测闭环。

A Codex skill for turning one-off AI ideas into repeatable workflows with prompts, tools, MCP integrations, checks, and evaluation loops.

Use this when the main stack direction is already mostly known. If the bigger question is still local model choice, deployment path, or LM Studio versus Ollama versus MLX, [local-ai-systems-studio](https://github.com/however-yir/codex-skill-local-ai-systems-studio) is the better first stop.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps design AI workflows that can be reused, inspected, and improved over time. It is built for prompt pipelines, local LLM setups, tool-using agents, workflow decomposition, and deciding when something should become a skill, script, or MCP server.

## Best For

- prompt pipeline design
- local LLM workflows
- MCP integration planning
- skill vs script vs tool decisions
- evaluation loop design
- reusable AI task packaging

## Inputs

Typical inputs:
- the repeatable task to solve
- any current prompt, script, or workflow draft
- available tools or MCP servers
- model constraints
- quality expectations and failure modes

## Outputs

Typical outputs:
- workflow specification
- prompt or prompt-stack design
- tool integration plan
- eval loop or rubric
- minimal implementation path

## Non-goals

This skill is not aimed at:
- one-off content generation only
- generic code fixes unrelated to AI workflows
- UI polish or presentation deliverables
- unstructured AI hype with no operating model

## Example Prompts

- `Help me turn this local LLM document workflow into something reusable.`
- `Should this be a skill, a script, or an MCP server?`
- `Design an eval loop for this agent workflow.`
- `Map inputs, tools, outputs, and failure checks for this AI task.`

## Notes

This skill is built to reduce ambiguity. The goal is not to make AI work sound impressive, but to make it repeatable and testable.
